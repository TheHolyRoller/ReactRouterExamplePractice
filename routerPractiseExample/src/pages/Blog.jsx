Today the dawn greets us with a fresh opportunity to draw near to the Lord, seek for Him and love Him with all of our heart, soul, mind and strength. As we adore Him, we will grow increasingly more aware of Him, and  less aware of ourselves and all of the circumstances surrounding us. As we magnify His Name...Oh God you are MY GOD (Psalm 63) our perspective is properly aligned to His eternal greatness and unchanging nature!  Oh Lord, You are my Redeemer,  my Savior, my Healer, my Provider, my Good Shepherd, my Wonderful Counselor, my Almighty God, my Everlasting Father, my Prince of Peace, my All in All! As we truly see Him today in His Word, we turn from being conformed to this world to being transformed by the renewing of our minds. You will really love reading and meditating on this threesome today...Psalm 42, 63, and 84. Be sure to write down what the Lord reveals to you so you will remember!

Think about Moses. He ascended Mount Sinai and there stood before the living God. The eyes of Moses were actually filled with God's sun-like glory; his ears actually heard the audible sound of the Lord's voice. Yet when Moses returned to the people, the Bible says he "did not know that the skin of his face shone" (Exod. 34:29). When the Israelites saw the fire of God's glory on the face of Moses, "they were afraid to come near him" (v. 30). They saw that  he had been with God. 

How the world needs people who have, like Moses, climbed closer to the Almighty, people who have stood in the sacred fire of God's presence.  People willing to leave behind  temporal and small thinking that prevents us from living each day in the reality of His presence and experiencing "Christ in us, the hope of glory!" The Lord is calling us to Arise to be desperate for Him, surrendered to Him, consumed by Him. He will teach us how to abide in Him moment by moment (John 15). 

Let's draw near to the Lord in worship, in loving His Word, in listening, and in prayer.  Make time for the Secret Place today, He will meet you there. Let's be thirsty for His presence.  He has invited us to come boldly to His throne of grace. To receive the help we need, we must arrive at His throne.  Our confidence is in Him alone, in His living Word!  Remember what Jesus said,  "everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened." (Matthew 7:8). Precious Holy Spirit teach us today how to live in Your presence, surrendered to Your will, transform us by Your Word and touch precious lives with your love through us today.
